# Scraper_Sender-Pub
This is a public version of a tool I am currently developing. This will be a trial of sorts. I intend for the finish product to be sold, however this free version with no built-in email targeting will remain free forever.

Use:
```
pip3 install -r reqs.txt
```
To install dependencies.

Use:
```
python3 scrapersender.py
```
To run.
